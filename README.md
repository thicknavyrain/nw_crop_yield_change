# 🌾❄️ Nuclear Winter Crop Yield Analysis

Code and scripts for calculating percentage changes in crop and grass yields under different soot emission scenarios associated with varying intensities of nuclear winters.

This project processes crop and grass yield data from NetCDF datasets provided by [Xia et al. (2022)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43016-022-00573-0), calculates percentage changes in yields for various crops and grasses across countries for the first 10 years post-nuclear winter, and outputs the results to CSV files. It performs spatial data processing, aggregation, and analysis, and generates visualizations to evaluate the impact of different nuclear winter scenarios on global agriculture.

The code can be run locally using Python. Setup instructions are below.

**Note**: The code does not have to be run to view the results. All outputs of the code can be found in the reports and data/processed folders. The reports folder also contains detailed documentation on the results.

## Setup

### Dependencies: Setup in Local Development Environment

#### Dependency Management with Poetry

See [https://python-poetry.org/docs/](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) for installation instructions.

Once Poetry is installed, navigate to the root folder of the repository and run:

```bash
poetry install
```

This command will install all the required dependencies listed in the pyproject.toml file.

To activate the virtual environment for this project using Poetry, run:

```bash
poetry shell
```

To exit the virtual environment, simply type:

```bash
exit
```

### Input Data Management

The raw data is included in the repository under the `data/raw` directory.

- Crop yield and grass production data are sourced from [Xia et al. (2022)](https://osf.io/yrbse/).
- Country shapefile for spatial analysis is sourced from the ALLFED [LosingIndustryCropYields](https://github.com/allfed/LosingIndustryCropYields/) project and is located in `data/external/World_Countries__Generalized_`.

Ensure that the data files are in the correct directories as specified in the project structure below.

## How to Run the Code

After setting up the Poetry environment as described above, you can run the analysis scripts.

### Calculate Yield Changes:

To process the yield data and calculate the percentage changes for different nuclear winter scenarios, run:

```bash
python src/1_yield_change_calculation.py
```

This script processes the yield data for various crops and grasses under different soot emission scenarios and outputs CSV files containing the percentage changes in yields for each country and year. The outputs are saved in the `data/processed` directory.

### Model Evaluation:

To evaluate the model's correspondence with the reference data (provided in `data/raw/rutgers_nw_production_raw.csv`), run:

```bash
python src/2_model_evaluation.py
```

This script compares the calculated yield changes with the reference data, computes evaluation metrics, and generates plots saved in the `reports/figures` directory.
